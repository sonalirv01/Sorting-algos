**About**

Sorting algorithms are fundamental to computer science and are widely used for data organization, search optimization, and data analysis. This project demonstrates how to implement some popular sorting algorithms in Java with explanations for each algorithm's logic and complexity.

**Algorithms**
**Bubble Sort**

Bubble Sort is a simple, comparison-based algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the array is sorted.

**Time Complexity:** 
O(nÂ²) in the worst and average cases, O(n) in the best case (when the array is already sorted).

**Space Complexity:**
O(1) (in-place sorting).

**Properties:** 
Stable, in-place sorting algorithm.
